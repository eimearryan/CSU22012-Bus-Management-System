## Summary of project

* Implementation of a bus management system based on Vancouver bus system data (which was previously obtained by using TransLink open API
[(Link)](https://developer.translink.ca/))
* The bus management system provides the following functionality:

    1) Finding shortest paths between 2 bus stops (as input by the user), returning the list of stops
       en route as well as the associated “cost”.

    2) Searching for a bus stop by full name or by the first few characters in the name, using a
       ternary search tree (TST), returning the full stop information for each stop matching the
       search criteria (which can be zero, one or more stops)

    3) Searching for all trips with a given arrival time, returning full details of all trips matching the
       criteria (zero, one or more), sorted by trip id

    4) Provide front interface enabling selection between the above features or an option to exit
       the programme, and enabling required user input.
